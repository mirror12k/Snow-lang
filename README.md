# Snow lang
The Snow programming language is a scripting language which compiles directly to lua.
Created because lua has way too much boilerplate.
It's purpose is to simplify lua programming with streamlined syntax and simpler class definitions.

## installation
Requires perl and the [Sugar utility library](https://github.com/mirror12k/perl-Sugar-utility-library).

## features
- compiles directly to valid lua
- dynamic whitespace
- streamlined all statements to just the bare necessities
- simplified table iteration with foreach
- forced declaration of variables so that you never accidentally reference a global when you wanted a local
- minimalistic table constructor which skips all the frills such as brackets and commas to simplify declaration of large tables or classes

## misc
This is still a work in progress, all feedback is welcome!
